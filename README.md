# flutter_ui_components

This repository contains a collection of reusable **Flutter UI components** that I’ve created to enhance my learning and practice. Each component is designed to be easily reused in other Flutter projects. I’ll also be sharing these components on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mairajmalik) as part of my ongoing learning journey.

## 📁 Where to Find Components

All UI components are located in:

lib/components/


You can simply **copy and paste** any component’s code into your project to start using it.

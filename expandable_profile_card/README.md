# Expandable Profile Card – Flutter UI Component

This Flutter project features a smooth and clean **Expandable Profile Card** with animation and a blinking "Tap to Expand/Close" text. It is designed as part of my Flutter learning journey, where I build and share polished UI components.

## 💡 Features
- Smooth card expand and collapse animation
- Blinking hint text using FadeTransition
- Centered card layout with profile image and details
- Clean and reusable component structure

## 📁 Folder Structure
flutter_ui_components/

## 🧠 What I Learned
- AnimationController and FadeTransition for text animation
- AnimatedCrossFade for smooth expansion
- Managing UI state in StatefulWidget
- Better use of layout widgets like Card, Column, SizedBox, etc.
